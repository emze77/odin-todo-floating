# Floating To-Do List

*Project of the [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)-Curriculum.*

I wanted to have a To-Do List, which is at the beginning google-like minimalistic and the UI grows with its complexity. So at the beginning, there is just a bar for a new task and the rest follows.


## Features

* **single bar for new Tasks**: in the beginning, there is nothing else
* **project/card-structure**: when you added projects, you can move the tasks between
* **accomplished-cards list**: styled as every task, there is a list with every accomplished task.
* **Theming**: you can select one of five theme-colors. The themes span from background to highlight-colors.
* **Priority Tasks**: Cards with higher priority are marked with theme-specific border-color and background.

## Learnings for next project

* **file-structure from the beginning**: don't be stingy with module files. Create BEM-folder-structure and files according the CMV-concept from the beginning. Restructuring hurts!

* **Avoid global variables**: don't expose important variables, but build iife-modules around them.



## Build-version

The project-state is far from ideal. The file-structures wasn't thought out clearly and the process to untangle the deck alone took some days (insane!). The deck now is pretty much what I think is a good practice for my level, while everything else is too tangled. 

Also, the styling is pretty raw. I wasn't really in the mood the spend more time on CSS at the moment.
